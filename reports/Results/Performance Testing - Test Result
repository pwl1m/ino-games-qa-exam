# Test Report: Game Performance Monitoring

## **Test Case Details**
- **Test Case ID:** TC009-PerformanceMonitoring
- **Test Title:** Monitor game performance under normal and heavy loads
- **Test Date:** 2024-12-12
- **Test Environment:**
  - **Operating System:** Windows 11
  - **CPU:** Intel i5-1135G7 @ 2.40 GHz (8 cores)
  - **Memory:** 20,480 MB
  - **GPU:** NVIDIA MX350 (2 GB VRAM)
  - **Monitor Refresh Rate:** 144 Hz
  - **Internet Speed:** 10 Gbps
  - **Browsers:** Chromium (Brave Browser) 1.73.97 (Chromium: 131.0.6778.108), Mozilla Firefox 133.0.3, Microsoft Edge 131.0.2903.86  
  - **Game Version** 1.34.10 

## **Test Scenario**
### **Scenario:** Verify game performance under normal and heavy load conditions

### **Observations:**
1. **XHR Logs Analysis:**
   - Using the DevTools in Brave and Firefox, XHR logs were analyzed during the tests.
   - Both browsers exhibited delays in responses for specific functions, as documented in the folder: `/Performance Testing - Media/`.
   - These delays are consistent across both browsers and isolated to the same functions.
   - **Impact Assessment:** Minor. The identified delays do not significantly affect gameplay.

2. **Visual Performance:**
   - No visible delays or slowdowns were observed during gameplay.
   - Loading times, transitions, and in-game animations were smooth and consistent.
   - Frame rates remained stable, providing a seamless user experience.

3. **System Utilization:**
   - CPU and GPU utilization remained within acceptable ranges during the tests.
   - Memory usage did not spike unexpectedly, and the game maintained stable operation.

4. **Network Impact:**
   - The game's network performance was analyzed, and the high-speed connection (10 Gbps) ensured minimal latency.
   - No packet loss or network bottlenecks were identified.

## **Test Results**
- **Status:** Passed  
- **Observations Summary:**
  - XHR delays noted in specific functions (minor impact).
  - Visual performance unaffected, with no noticeable lags or stuttering.
  - System and network resources were utilized efficiently, maintaining stability throughout.

## **Conclusion**
The game demonstrates reliable performance under both normal and heavy loads. While minor delays were noted in specific XHR responses, they do not impact gameplay significantly. Visual performance remained optimal, meeting user expectations.

## **Test Status**
- **Result:** Passed
