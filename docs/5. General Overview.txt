Game Choose: Esqueleto Explosivo 2

○ Even though this is not a question, we’d like to hear why you selected this game.
What are the ups and downs?
A: I liked the math, unlike some others I had tested in the past, I also liked the math it used, I hadn't tested this type of math at the previous company I worked for, the Bonus music was a highlight, I liked it a lot, the downside may have been that the new pay table possibilities are valid most of the time only for skulls that come from above but at the same time it becomes fun because it makes you more nervous trying to get the next sequence right.
And the other games depending on the time I accessed the site were down.

○ What would you consider a factor that would make you play again?
A: The music definitely

○ Was this an engaging experience?
Yes, a lot, there are no cheats like in other games, this makes testing and making plays as if a player were testing directly on a real casino platform, although I understand that the paytable has changed the RTP.
And the skeletons singing are awesome.
