1. What is the primary purpose of Quality Assurance (QA)?
A: The main purpose of software quality is to ensure that all stakeholders obtain success and satisfaction from its use, to ensure that the software meets the needs of users efficiently and effectively.

2. What is the difference between a test case and a test plan?
A test case will address specific scenarios involving a system functionality or module. A test plan aims to identify which strategies and tools will be used, which critical points will be tested, scope, schedule, etc.

3. What does the term 'regression testing' refer to?
Regression testing is about ensuring that previous system functionality has not broken after implementing new functionality or fixing defects.

4. How would you create a template to describe bugs on a software that is being constantly released?
System Functionality Name | Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the error | Description of the result obtained | Description of the expected result | Evidence of the Error (Prints, data, error logs...)

5. What is the importance of test automation in QA? What would you explore in terms of automation for games being developed in a short period of time?
Test automation is especially important in regression scenarios, to ensure that the functionalities in operation have not been impacted by new additions. Automation is important because it is impossible to manually cover all scenarios in a reasonable period of time.

6. Describe the main stages of the Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC).
a) Requirements analysis, documentation, architecture planning, prototyping.
b) Development and testing.
c) Approval.
d) Maintenance.

7. How would you handle a situation where a bug you reported is marked as 'not
reproducible' by the development team?
I would call the developer for a call where we could investigate together the cause of the problem, showing him how it works in my environment, in order to discover particularities in the way the scenario is executed and/or data/environment variables. If it were not possible to make a call, I would gather more evidence detailing as much as possible how I found the problem so that he could carry out a new investigation.
