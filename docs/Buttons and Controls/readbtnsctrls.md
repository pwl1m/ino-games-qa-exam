# Test Case Directory: Generic Format

This directory contains a collection of test case specifications for various features within the application. Each test case document will follow a standard format to ensure consistency, clarity, and ease of use.

## Structure of a Test Case
Each test case generally includes the following sections:

**Description:**  
A brief summary of the functionality or scenario being tested. This sets the scope and purpose of the test.

**Pre-Conditions:**  
A list of conditions or requirements that must be met before executing the test. For example, these might include certain states of the system, available user interface elements, or specific data configurations.

**Post-Conditions:**  
The expected state of the system after the test steps have been completed. Post-conditions help verify that the intended changes or results are achieved.

**Steps:**  
A sequence of actions to perform, often following a "Given/When/Then" style. Each step should indicate the action taken and the expected outcome, allowing testers to verify whether the feature behaves as intended.

## Example of a Generic Test Case

### Description
Verifies that the system correctly updates and displays a given value after user input.

### Pre-Conditions
- The user interface is fully loaded.
- The relevant input field or button is visible and enabled.

### Post-Conditions
- The displayed value should be updated according to the userâ€™s input.
- The system should not produce any errors or inconsistent states.

### Steps
**Given** the application is loaded and all necessary elements are visible  
**When** the user enters a valid value into the input field and confirms the action  
**Then** the system should update the display to reflect the new value  
**And** the application should remain stable and responsive
