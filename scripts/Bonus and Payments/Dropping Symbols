### Description
Verify that winning symbols are correctly replaced by new and/or existing symbols and that the replacement process continues as long as new wins occur in a 5-reel, 99-payline video slot game.

### Pre-Conditions
- The slot game (5 reels, 99 pay ways) is loaded and ready to play.
- A valid bet has been placed, and the spin button is available.

### Post-Conditions
- When a winning combination is achieved, those symbols should be removed and replaced.
- The replacement process should continue automatically if new winning combinations occur.
- The process should stop only when no further wins are generated.

### Steps
Given the game is loaded with 5 reels and 99 connecting pay ways  
When the player initiates a spin that results in at least one winning combination  
Then the winning symbols should be removed from the reels  
And new symbols should fall into place or appear in their positions  
And if these newly placed symbols form another winning combination, the process should repeat  
And this cycle should continue until no further winning combinations are formed  
And at the end, the final result should be displayed and recorded without errors.
