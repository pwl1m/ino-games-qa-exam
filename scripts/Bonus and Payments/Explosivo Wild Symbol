### Description
Verify that the Explosivo Wild symbol behaves correctly by substituting for all non-Scatter symbols and exploding surrounding symbols within its vicinity, while respecting the exceptions for Scatter and high-pay symbols.

### Pre-Conditions
- The slot game is loaded and ready to spin.
- The Explosivo Wild symbol is active and can appear on the reels.
- There are multiple symbol types present, including standard, high-pay, and Scatter symbols.

### Post-Conditions
- When an Explosivo Wild lands, it substitutes for any symbols needed to form a winning combination, except for Scatters.
- Upon landing, the Explosivo Wild explodes a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 8 adjacent standard symbols.
- Scatter and high-pay symbols remain unaffected by the explosion.
- The resulting reel state should accurately reflect removed symbols and any cascading replacements.

### Steps
Given the game is loaded and symbols are spinning normally  
When the player initiates a spin and the result includes at least one Explosivo Wild symbol  
Then the Explosivo Wild should substitute for any non-Scatter symbols to complete winning combinations  
And it should explode the surrounding standard symbols (3 to 8 positions around it)  
And the Scatter and high-pay symbols should remain untouched  
And the reel should update to reflect removed symbols and any subsequent cascading or replacement symbols  
And any resulting wins should be calculated and displayed accurately.
